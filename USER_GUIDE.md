## 4. Setting Up Your Recording Session

Before starting a recording, you can configure your session to match the exact context of your discussion.

### Step 1: Name Your Meeting
At the top of the Left Panel, click the default name **"New Meeting"** and type a customized title (e.g., `Q3 Product Strategy Sync`). The application will stamp the meeting with the current weekday, month, and date automatically.

### Step 2: Select a Meeting Template
If you want to apply instant settings optimized for specific meeting types, choose from the pre-configured grid:

* **Standup:** Enabled speaker identification (diarization), enabled action extraction, summarized in concise bullets. Perfect for daily syncs.
* **Interview:** Enabled speaker identification, disabled action extraction, formatted in detailed, clean narratives.
* **Lecture:** Disabled speaker identification (single main speaker), disabled action items, formatted in exhaustive detailed summary paragraphs.
* **Sales Call:** Enabled speaker diarization, enabled actions, formatted in highly detailed client summary notes.
* **Brainstorm:** Enabled speaker diarization, enabled action items, summarized in flexible, rapid bullet points.
* **Podcast:** Enabled diarization, disabled action items, summarized in detailed paragraphs tracking key dialog segments.

> [!TIP]
> Selecting a template will automatically suggest an appropriate title for your meeting if you haven't renamed it!

### Step 3: Choose Your Capture Mode
* **Microphone Mode (Live Capture):** Utilizes your device's default microphone. Shows a live, animated visualizer canvas matching your vocal frequencies.
* **Upload Mode (Pre-recorded Files):** Allows you to upload pre-recorded meetings or classes.
  * *Supported file formats:* `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.webm`, `.mp4`.
  * *File size limit:* Strictly validated up to **25 MB** to ensure fast serverless execution.

### Step 4: Refine Processing Parameters
Under **Recorder Settings**, toggles are available to fine-tune the AI execution context:
* **Speaker Diarization:** Toggle this on to automatically distinguish who said what (e.g., `Speaker 1`, `Speaker 2`).
* **Action Items Extraction:** Toggle this on to let the AI build an interactive, prioritized task list.
* **Language Select:** Pick the spoken language (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, etc.) to optimize the transcription engine.
* **Summary Style:** Choose between **Detailed** (full structural breakdown), **Concise** (high-level paragraphs), and **Bullets** (rapid key takeaways).

## 5. The AI Processing Pipeline

When you click **Process with AI**, Verbatim initiates a secure, multi-stage transaction:

```
[Audio Capture] ➔ [32kbps Vocal Compression] ➔ [Groq Whisper (STT)] ➔ [LLaMA 3 (Nvidia NIM)] ➔ [Structured JSON Output]
```

1. **Vocal Compression:** Raw audio chunk files are combined and compressed using the client-side recorder.
2. **Audio Filtering & Upload:** The backend verifies size constraints (max 25MB) and processes the payload.
3. **Whisper Transcription (Groq Engine):** Groq's high-speed Whisper implementation transcribes the voice stream.
4. **LLaMA 3 Insights Engine (Nvidia):** Analyzes the raw transcript using a system role prompt injection. It separates the summary, identifies speakers, drafts actions, and isolates key sentiments.
5. **JSON Structuring:** Generates a clean, validated JSON package that is piped to the client UI and cached in the Supabase DB.

## 6. Analyzing Meeting Results

Once processed, the Right Panel lights up with structured deliverables. Let's explore the four analytical tabs:

### 1. Stats Row & Speaker Chips
* **Stats Row:** High-level metrics showing the exact session duration, total word count, and unique speaker count.
* **Speaker Chips:** Color-coded speaker identifiers showing who participated.

### 2. Tab 1: TLDR
* **Key Quote:** A featured visual block showcasing the most impactful quote of the entire meeting.
* **Main Points:** A chronological list of key highlights, summaries, and thematic milestones.

### 3. Tab 2: Transcript
* A beautiful, interactive chat-style view of the entire conversation.
* If diarization was enabled, messages are categorized by speaker chips with matching timestamps.
* A built-in custom audio player lets you listen back to the meeting recording at any time.

### 4. Tab 3: Actions
An interactive checklist of tasks extracted by the AI:
* **Task checkboxes:** Mark tasks as completed on the fly.
* **Priority tags:** Color-coded priority badges (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`).
* **Assignee badges:** Shows who is responsible for each task based on the transcript context.

### 5. Tab 4: Insights
* **Sentiment Indicator:** Displays the overall emotional tone of the discussion:
  * 🟢 **Aligned:** Positive, constructive, collaborative agreement.
  * 🟡 **Uncertain:** Undecided issues, speculative discussions.
  * 🔴 **Tense:** Strong debate, conflicting opinions.
* **Decisions Log:** A clean bullet-point summary of all formal decisions agreed upon.
* **Risks identified:** A section warning about highlighted roadblocks, technical debt, or missed milestones.

## 7. Meeting Vault & RAG-Powered Semantic Search

The **Meeting History** tab (`/meetings`) houses your secure meeting vault.

```
+───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────+
| [Sparkles] Vault AI Search                                |
| [ Search history, or ask "What did we decide?"        ]   |
+───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────+
```

### Vault AI Search (RAG Engine)
You can search previous records by matching titles. However, the true power of Verbatim lies in **Vault AI Search**:
1. Type a natural language question in the search bar ending with a question mark (`?`), for example:
   * *“What did we decide about the budget?”*
   * *“Who is responsible for the API deployment?”*
   * *“What was the main topic of the marketing brainstorm?”*
2. Press the **Send (arrow)** button or hit **Enter**.
3. Verbatim's RAG system performs a semantic lookup across all your historical meeting transcripts, feeds the relevant contexts into the AI, and outputs a synthesized, paragraph-long **Vault AI** answer directly in an animated card.

### Sentiment Filters
Quickly filter your entire history using sentiment tags on the top right:
* Click **Aligned** to see only collaborative, highly productive meetings.
* Click **Tense** to immediately pull up meetings featuring heavy debates or outstanding conflicts.
* Click **Uncertain** to find meetings where follow-up clarifications are still pending.

## 10. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

To get the absolute best results from Verbatim, consider the following technical recommendations:

> [!TIP]
> **Microphone Placement:** For clear speaker diarization, ensure the microphone is placed centrally in the meeting room or use a dedicated USB boundary mic.
>
> **Background Noise:** Try to record in spaces with minimal background echoes. The AI can filter light noise, but severe acoustics might blur speaker separations.
>
> **File uploads:** If your file exceeds 25MB, use a free audio compression utility (like Audacity or FFmpeg) to output a compressed mono vocal stream before uploading.

### Frequently Asked Questions
* **Q: Why does my upload fail?**
  * *A:* Verify your file is under the 25MB safety boundary and has an approved audio format extension.
* **Q: How does the app handle long processing times?**
  * *A:* We've optimized the API timeouts to 60 seconds on serverless hosts. If a meeting is exceptionally long, use the Free vocal compression switch to keep files light!
